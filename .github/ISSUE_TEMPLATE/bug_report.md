## Bug report

Summarize what you were trying to do when the issue appeared.

**To Reproduce**

Summarize how to reproduce the behavior. For example:
1. Make a terragrunt file that calls the function `foo`
2. Run the command `terragrunt-atlantis-config --example`

**Expected behavior**

No error. I expected the generated Atlantis config to look like:
```
example good config
```

**Actual behavior**

Describe what happened and why it had a negative impact.
```
example bad config or error
```

**Relevant Terragrunt files**

Please provide at least a snippet of relevant terragrunt code that is causing terragrunt-atlantis-config to fail.
Ideally, a link to a repository with the smallest set of code needed to reproduce the issue.
