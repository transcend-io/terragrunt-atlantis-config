## Bug report

**To Reproduce**
Summarize how to reproduce the behavior. For example:
1. Make a terragrunt file that calls the function `foo`
2. Run the command `terragrunt-atlantis-config --example`

**Expected behavior**
No error, the generated Atlantis config looks like:
```
example good config
```

**Actual behavior**
Describe what happened and why it had a negative impact.
```
example bad config or error
```

**Relevant Terragrunt files**
Please provide at least a snippet of relevant terragrunt code that is causing terragrunt-atlantis-config to fail.
Ideally, a link to a repository with the smallest set of code needed to reproduce the issue.
